I've never felt this far from God
I almost feel like giving up again
In my bones
In my blood
There's a sickness
I'd change if I could
But the fire
That rages
Inside me
Erased all the good
Father help me
Do you understand?
All my life I've been a wicked man
Show me mercy and comfort me
I need to find
Redemption
Redemption
Redemption


I've never been this far from peace
I'm disappearing out of reach again
In my head
In my heart
There's a hollow
That's starting to show
It's the poison
That fills up the void
And it's taking a hold
